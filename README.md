# Air Quality App

This project has two motivations, one personal and one technical:

1. A recent trip home to Hong Kong and to the neighbouring city of Macau made me realise how keeping a track of pollution has become a daily habit of some people.
2. With some time over the holiday period, I wanted to learn a bit more about the newly announced [`react-cache`](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/11/27/react-16-roadmap.html#react-16x-mid-2019-the-one-with-suspense-for-data-fetching). This, as of now (along with Hooks), is still in alpha, so it is not recommended for use in production code.

## To use

Assuming you have node and yarn installed:

```
git clone https://github.com/lwkchan/air-quality-app.git

yarn

yarn start
```
